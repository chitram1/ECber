ecber: an expansion of the ccber `R` Package used for the HERD Lab at UC Davis 
============================================================================================================
ccber was developed for the Conte Center @ UCI and ecber was edited by Dr. Elisa Ugarte and Chitra Mukherjee from UC Davis.

The goal of this package is for estimating the behavioral entropy rate, and our package includes additional features such as 
increased tolerance values (including 1, 2, 3, etc.) for calculating reliability.
