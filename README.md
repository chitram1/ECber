ecber: an expansion of the ccber `R` Package used for the HERD Lab at UC Davis 
============================================================================================================
ccber was developed for the Conte Center @ UCI and ecber was edited by Dr. Elisa Ugarte and Chitra Mukherjee from UC Davis.

The goal of this package is to estimate the behavioral entropy rate, and our package includes additional features such as 
increasing the tolerance values (including a buffer of 1, 2, 3, seconds etc.) for calculating the reliability (similarity) between two coders.
